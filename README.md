# Guitar-Scale-Tuning-Tool
Shows which note is on which fret, depending on how you tuned your guitar

## Ideas for the future:
- drop-down of instruments
- fret number before each note
- simplify html (such as prior mod) so that I can implement buttons for css skins
- Javascript plans:
  -- html basically being clear of elements, so the submittion button wipes all elements, creates new unique ones, places them on the page
  -- javascript handling html's input:select:options (cleaning up html for css skins. next year i could give out a few pull requests for hacktoberfest)
  -- 3d array: 00 - 60 : strings, 000 - 220 : frets. <p> elements will be stored liiiike so <p class="40 110">foo</p>
  -- another select element with a list of scales and arpeggios. select one, click on a note, all in the same algorythm will light up (which is why everything under "javascript" is very necessary)
